# Kick Inn â€“ Backend Modules & API Spec (MVP)

This file outlines backend service modules, core API endpoints, and data contracts  
to support the MVP functionality as described in the Functional Specs.

## ðŸ”§ Backend Modules Overview

Each module is a microservice or decoupled logic component with clear responsibilities.

```json
{
  "auth": "User registration, login, session handling",
  "kyc": "Identity verification, document upload, risk scoring",
  "deal": "Deal creation, status update, founder dashboard",
  "investment": "Investment logic, payment gateway integration, escrow",
  "token": "Token creation, smart contract interface, metadata",
  "contributor": "Role listing, contract signing, milestone tracking",
  "notifications": "Trigger-based email/push communication",
  "admin": "Platform moderation, compliance review, audit log"
}

## ðŸ”š Notes

- Each module should expose a RESTful interface via internal API.
- Role-based access control must be enforced at route-level.
- Each event must trigger a write to the event log for analytics.
