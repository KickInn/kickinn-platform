2. Core Principles
	•	All startup creation is initiated by ideators, not founders
	•	All execution is managed by AI agents with milestone-driven gating (stop-and-go logic)
	•	SAFE tokens are the only asset distributed to investors and contributors
	•	Contributors are contracted via smart contracts with scope, delivery, and IP terms
	•	Investors only see AI-approved, post-MVP, validated campaigns
	•	No manual override: AI logic enforces validation gates

4. Deployment Strategy (Recommended)
	•	Monorepo: Core App + API + Contract Interfaces
	•	Frontend: React/Next.js + Tailwind
	•	Backend: Node.js + PostgreSQL (Supabase optional)
	•	Contracts: Solidity (verified via Hardhat)
	•	DevOps: GitHub Actions, Vercel (Frontend), AWS or Fly.io (backend)
	•	CI/CD: Auto-deploy staging → prod with commit triggers + test suite

5. Dev Handoff Bundle (Include)
	•	Swagger/OpenAPI JSON export
	•	SQL DB schema (ready for migration tools)
	•	Solidity interface files (.sol)
	•	Flowmap PNG/SVG for onboarding
	•	PDF version of Functional Spec (clean export)
All files organized and version-controlled for delivery. Kick Inn's system is now fully document-driven and ready for development boot-up.
