2. High-Level Business Goals
Deal Framework: One Focused Stage
Seed Stage (Post-MVP, Pre-Traction) Kick Inn exclusively supports startups that have completed their MVP and validated a core market opportunity. The average funding ticket is set at $500K USDT, structured to support:
	•	Go-to-market execution
	•	Initial traction acquisition
	•	Liquidity buffer to mitigate early-stage cash risk
Eligibility Criteria:
	•	Functional MVP or prototype tested with real users
	•	Clear use-of-funds plan tied to KPIs

Investor Instruments:
	•	Immediate equity issuance registered in cap table
	•	SAFE tokens minted at close for liquidity and secondary trading
SAFE Token Design
SAFE Tokens are digital instruments with embedded legal equivalence to future equity rights. Their purpose is to:
	•	Provide investors with tradable exposure to early-stage growth
	•	Reduce liquidity friction for participants
	•	Encode equity terms via smart contract for trustless enforcement
Each token contract must:
	•	Be mapped to an auditable equity agreement
	•	Be compliant with jurisdictional limits on speculative assets
	•	Allow price discovery through supported DEX integration
