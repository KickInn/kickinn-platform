Kick Inn ‚Äì User Journey & Flowmap (MVP Annotated)
This version includes step-by-step annotations of the ecosystem to clarify role transitions, AI-driven controls, and critical checkpoints that govern user actions and progress.
This document defines the primary user journeys across core roles: Investors, Founders, and Contributors. It can guide the UX/UI team and help clarify the conversion path, onboarding friction, and core interactions per persona.

1. Investor Journey
üõ§Ô∏è Flow Stages:
	1	Awareness: Discover platform via campaign or referral
	2	Registration: Sign up + select role = Investor
	3	KYC Flow: Complete identity + accreditation flow
	4	Deal Discovery:
	‚ó¶	Filter by stage, geography, sector
	‚ó¶	Compare metrics, traction, tokenomics
	5	Investment Checkout:
	‚ó¶	Choose deal ‚Üí Enter amount ‚Üí Accept terms ‚Üí Pay via wallet 
	6	Confirmation:
	‚ó¶	Tokens minted
	‚ó¶	See deal in dashboard
	7	Portfolio View:
	‚ó¶	Track token prices, project updates, and deal milestones
	8	Optional Secondary Trade (future):
	‚ó¶	Sell tokens P2P (if DEX enabled)
üîÅ Key Loops:
	‚Ä¢	Re-engagement via notifications (new deals, token events)
	‚Ä¢	Repeat investments across verticals or geographies

2. Ideator Journey (AI-Driven, Annotated)
üõ§Ô∏è Flow Stages with Annotations:
	1	Registration: Sign up and select role = Ideator‚Ä®‚Üí Access granted to idea submission form only
	2	Idea Submission:‚Ä®‚Üí Ideator submits a real-world pain point (not a startup idea)‚Ä®‚Üí AI Agent validates clarity and feasibility, then auto-generates:
	‚ó¶	Problem framing + pitch
	‚ó¶	MVP sketch
	‚ó¶	Tokenomics draft
	‚ó¶	Go-to-market plan‚Ä®‚Üí Output = Phase 1 Proposal [requires AI approval to move on]
	3	Validation & Review:‚Ä®‚Üí AI agent checks internal viability (market match, demand proxies, originality)‚Ä®‚Üí If approved = green flag issued ‚Üí unlocks next phase‚Ä®‚Üí If rejected = AI suggests modifications
	4	Team Assembly:‚Ä®‚Üí AI auto-generates role map (skills needed)‚Ä®‚Üí Contributors matched based on availability, past score, domain
	5	MVP Generation & Testing:‚Ä®‚Üí Contributors build MVP OR AI uses low-code agents to generate prototype‚Ä®‚Üí AI launches testing campaigns (waitlists, fake doors, signal collection)‚Ä®‚Üí Must hit validation KPIs to proceed to fundraising
	6	Campaign Launch:‚Ä®‚Üí If traction validated = investor-facing campaign is auto-published‚Ä®‚Üí Includes SAFE token structure, use of funds, milestone roadmap
	7	Funding & Execution:‚Ä®‚Üí Investors fund campaign (500K USDT avg)‚Ä®‚Üí Smart contract releases funds in milestone tranches‚Ä®‚Üí AI agent oversees progress, pauses next tranche until previous task = done
üîÅ AI-Controlled Loops:
	‚Ä¢	No human can skip steps ‚Äî each action must pass through a stop-and-go checkpoint
	‚Ä¢	AI re-allocates tokens dynamically based on actual contributor performance and traction results
	‚Ä¢	All progress, funding and execution governed by milestones validated by agent logic
	‚Ä¢	Update investor dashboard with progress, KPIs
	‚Ä¢	Each phase is controlled by an AI agent in stop-and-go mode: no next step is triggered without a green flag from the previous one. Tokenomics or resource allocation is automatically adjusted by the agent when validation thresholds are met.

3. Skilled Contributor Journey
üõ§Ô∏è Flow Stages:
	1	Discovery:
	‚ó¶	Browse open roles per deal, sorted by domain
	2	Apply / Accept Role:
	‚ó¶	View compensation (token %, optional salary)
	‚ó¶	Accept ‚Üí smart contract signed
	3	Delivery & Review:
	‚ó¶	Upload deliverables ‚Üí approval/revision cycle
	4	Compensation:
	‚ó¶	Tokens released (onchain)
üîÅ Key Loops:
	‚Ä¢	Role rating system / contributor profile building
	‚Ä¢	Repeat participation in new deals or founder collab

Cross-Persona Integration
The Kick Inn platform is designed for autonomous, modular collaboration between personas via AI-mediated coordination. Each integration point reflects how users engage across roles, with minimal friction and high trust.
	‚Ä¢	Ideator + Contributor:
	‚ó¶	No traditional founder-initiated negotiation. Once an idea is approved, AI agents identify required roles and propose structured smart contracts.
	‚ó¶	Contributors review and accept offers via smart interface. Upon agreement, contracts are auto-deployed and project dashboards are updated.
	‚Ä¢	Investor + Deal:
	‚ó¶	Investors view only AI-approved campaigns. All content is verified, structured, and backed by live validation data.
	‚ó¶	Token distribution models are dynamic and governed by agent logic ‚Äî visible in real-time and adjusted based on validation checkpoints and contributor engagement. No equity is issued or tracked; all value exchange occurs through tokenized SAFE logic.
	‚Ä¢	Contributor + Investor:
	‚ó¶	Investors gain additional confidence through contributor reputation, past performance, and completion stats.
	‚ó¶	Contributor activity enhances deal credibility and influences platform-wide visibility.
This cross-functional architecture is coordinated entirely through AI agents, who gate every progression with stop-and-go checkpoints and adapt tokenomics or team allocation based on real-time milestones.
	‚Ä¢	Founder + Contributor:
	‚ó¶	Contract negotiation + auto-onboarding into project dashboard
	‚Ä¢	Investor + Deal:
	‚ó¶	Live campaign metrics, conversion % visible
	‚Ä¢	Contributor + Investor:
	‚ó¶	Investors can filter deals by contributor reputation

UX Notes for MVP:
	‚Ä¢	Use progressive onboarding to reduce drop-off
	‚Ä¢	Show KYC-required badge early to set expectation
	‚Ä¢	Standardize deal page layout (pitch, video, tokenomics, FAQ)
	‚Ä¢	Ensure roles/contracts use smart UI: toggle + preview + disclaimer prompt

This flowmap ensures the experience is optimized around traction, trust, and transparency ‚Äî while staying lean for speed and data collection. Next step: wireframes + user testing rounds.
